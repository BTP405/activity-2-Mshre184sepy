a. In the given below, code blocks each program snippet does to compute for the result are:

-> Approach 1: This method provides a function called doubleL(n), which uses a for loop to create a list of doubled values from 0 to n-1 given an integer n as input. The list is then returned by the function. The function's for loop calls doubleL(5) and outputs each member of the returned list, separated by a colon, after it.

-> Approach 2: This method creates a list using a comprehension list where the for loop will iterate from 0-4 as range is already provided as 5. The list will be created as the doubled value list within the range and the output will be printed followed by the colon.

-> Approach 3: This method uses the yield keyword to construct a generator function called doubleG(n). The generator produces doubles of any numbers between 0 and n-1. The function's for loop calls doubleG(5) and outputs each produced value, separated by a colon.

b. The function doubleG(n): This is a generator function in python. The generator function uses a yield keyword to generate a sequence of values one at a time rather than creating an entire list at once.

-> Advantages : It can conserve memory, particularly when working with huge datasets, because it creates values on the fly rather than storing them all at once. This is more memory-efficient than list-based techniques (such as doubleL and doubleG), particularly when the range of values is vast. Additionally, generators can perform better when only a subset of data are required.
